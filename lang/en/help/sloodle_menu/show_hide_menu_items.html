<h4>Show/Hide Menu Items</h4>
<p>
 You can use the Sloodle Menu block configuration page to show or hide specific menu items.
 Note that certain items will always be hidden under certain circumstances.
 For example, the links to the "Sloodle configuration page" and "Notecard setup page" will
 never be displayed to students and teachers.
